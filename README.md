## Project Dependencies
Benchmark algorithm and metrics utilize [Raffaele Conforti's Research Code](https://github.com/raffaeleconforti/ResearchCode).

## Compile
[Raffaele Conforti's Research Code](https://github.com/raffaeleconforti/ResearchCode) has to be installed in order to run this project code.

## Further Acknowledgements
The basic Petri net implementation is based on [Erko Rishtein's Petri net implementation](https://github.com/ErkoRisthein/conformance-checker/).
Furthermore, we thank Raffaele Conforti for making his extensive research code available.
